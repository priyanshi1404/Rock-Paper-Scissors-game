# Rock-Paper-Scissors-game

This is a Rock-paper-scissors game.

The following code can run on an editor(notepad etc), online compiler and IDE's.

In the following code, first choice from **user** is asked and after the **user** enters his/her choice, the **computer** makes its move.
A random move is generated by computer using the **inbuilt function** i.e., **int computer=rd.nextInt(3)+1**.

Here, this function generates number - 1,2 & 3. Because this function, say **int a=rd.nextInt(n);**
generates number starting from 0(incluisve) and n(exclusive). If **1** is added to the function then, the range shifts from **1-n**
However, we can use numbers-0,1 & 2 but for better representation I have used numbers starting from 1.

The code file is attached to this repository.

This code efficiently satisfies the main motive of the **ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS GAME.**

The output is as follows for the following code:
